Description: The functions allow for the numerical evaluation of some commonly used entropy measures, such as Shannon entropy, RÃ©nyi entropy, Havrda and Charvat entropy, and Arimoto entropy, at selected parametric values from several well-known and widely used probability distributions. Moreover, the functions also compute the relative loss of these entropies using the truncated distributions. Related works include: Awad, A. M., & Alawneh, A. J. (1987).
